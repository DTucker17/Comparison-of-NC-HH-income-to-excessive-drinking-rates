# US Public Health Data reposity---Project-3---ENLG105
# Introduction
This repository contains instructional materials and datasets concerning a broad spectrum of public information ranging from public health to socio-economic status. It was created as a product for an ENGL105 project at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

This repository contains:

Four python notbooks:
1. Module detailing how to use the Pandas package for data analysis. (pt1)
2. Module detailing how to use the Pandas package for data analysis. (pt2)
3. A module of Python basics.
4. A Module detailing how to replicated the subset of data.

Two datasets:
1. Master dataset containing many criteria and covering every county in the US.
2. Subset of data linking excessive drinking habits to median household income.

# Origin
The overall dataset, and instructional material covering Pandas and Python, was contributed by the professor of the class. The data-subset, graphics and process documentation were created by the student.

# Purpose
The data-subset was created to allow easier analysis of the link between Excessive drinking habits and median household income for the years 2014 in the state of North Carolina. It is broken down by county to allow more detailed regional analysis. 

The code in the instructional python notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to replicated the subset from the larger dataset. These instructions can be used, with minor alterations, to break down the larger dataset into other subsets based on different criteria. 

The instructional material on how to use Pandas and the basic functions of Python can be used to allow deeper understanding of the data-subset creation instructions. They provide a more detailed breakdown of how seperate a dataset into subsets.

Lastly, this repository could serve as a baseline for anyone looking to create their own repository. This one was created with minimal knowledge of Github, Python and Anaconda as a whole; therefore, it is necessarily basic in layout and provides an uncomplicated model on which you can build an even better product.![North Carolina Median household income chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118189262/202750861-062b3036-8025-4247-affb-25af2f6138c5.png = 100x20)
