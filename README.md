# Does Median house-hold income impact the rate of excess drinking?
# Introduction
This repository contains instructional materials and datasets concerning a broad spectrum of public information ranging from public health to socio-economic status. It was created as a product for an ENGL105 project at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

**Within the repository there are:**

**Instructional python notebooks:**
* Module detailing how to use the Pandas package for data analysis. (pt1)
* Module detailing how to use the Pandas package for data analysis. (pt2)
* A module of Python basics.

**Datasets:**
* Master dataset containing many criteria and covering every county in the US.
* Subset of data linking excessive drinking habits to median household income.
* Graphical comparison between stats, organized by county.

**Additional documents**
* Licensing agreement.
* Process documentation.

# Instructions for accessing the datasets
1. Ensure that you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed.
2. Open [JupyterLab](https://github.com/DTucker17/Comparison-of-NC-HH-income-to-excessive-drinking-rates/blob/main/Images/Anaconda%20nav%20page.png) via Anaconda Navigator.
3. Copy the files in the Data folder into your own directory and open them in JupyterLab.

# Where did the repository come from?
The overall dataset, and instructional material covering Pandas and Python, was contributed by the professor of the class. The data-subset, graphics and process documentation were created by the student.

# Why was this repository built?
The data-subset was created to allow easier analysis of the link between Excessive drinking habits and median household income for the years 2014 in the state of North Carolina. It is broken down by county to allow more detailed regional analysis. In creating this repository, we seek to determine if there is a link between house hold income and the habit of excess drinking. Median HH income gives us the dollar amount of income at which 50% of the population are above and 50% are below.

Future contributors to the repository might consider adding data that compares other income levels to the same drinking statistics of 2014. This would allow us to determine whether lower or higher income showed any impact.

# What can this repository be used for?
The code in the process documentation notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to replicated the subset from the larger dataset. These instructions can be used, with minor alterations, to break down the larger dataset into other subsets based on different criteria. 

The instructional material on how to use Pandas and the basic functions of Python can be used to allow deeper understanding of the data-subset creation instructions. They provide a more detailed breakdown of how seperate a dataset into subsets.

Lastly, this repository could serve as a baseline for anyone looking to create their own repository. This one was created with minimal knowledge of Github, Python and Anaconda as a whole; therefore, it is necessarily basic in layout and provides an uncomplicated model on which you can build an even better product.
